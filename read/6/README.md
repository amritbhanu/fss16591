## (ii) Keywords:

* (ii1) **Software defect prediction**: Software Defect Prediction (SDP) is one of the most assisting activities of the Testing Phase of SDLC. It identifies the modules that are defect prone and require extensive testing. This way, the testing resources can be used efficiently without violating the constraints.

* (ii2) **Meta-Analysis**: In statistics, meta-analysis comprises statistical methods for contrasting and combining results from different studies, in the hope of identifying patterns among study results, sources of disagreement among those results, or other interesting relationships that may come to light in the context of multiple studies.

* (ii3) **Researcher Bias**: Research bias, also called experimenter bias, is a process where the scientists performing the research influence the results, in order to portray a certain outcome.

## (iii) Brief Notes:

* (iii1) **Motivation** : The ability to predict defect-prone software components would be valuable. Consequently, there have been many empirical studies to evaluate the performance of different techniques endeavouring to accomplish this effectively. However, no one technique dominates and so designing a reliable defect prediction model remains problematic. This paper seek to make sense of the many conflicting experimental results and understand which factors have the largest effect on predictive performance.
