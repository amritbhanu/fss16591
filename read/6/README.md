## (ii) Keywords:

* (ii1) **Software defect prediction**: Software Defect Prediction (SDP) is one of the most assisting activities of the Testing Phase of SDLC. It identifies the modules that are defect prone and require extensive testing. This way, the testing resources can be used efficiently without violating the constraints.

* (ii2) **Meta-Analysis**: In statistics, meta-analysis comprises statistical methods for contrasting and combining results from different studies, in the hope of identifying patterns among study results, sources of disagreement among those results, or other interesting relationships that may come to light in the context of multiple studies.

* (ii3) **Researcher Bias**: Research bias, also called experimenter bias, is a process where the scientists performing the research influence the results, in order to portray a certain outcome.
