## (ii) Keywords:

* (ii1) **Software defect prediction**: Software Defect Prediction (SDP) is one of the most assisting activities of the Testing Phase of SDLC. It identifies the modules that are defect prone and require extensive testing. This way, the testing resources can be used efficiently without violating the constraints.

* (ii2) **Experimental Design**: The design of experiments (DOE, DOX, or experimental design) is the design of any task that aims to describe or explain the variation of information under conditions that are hypothesized to reflect the variation.

* (ii3) **Classification Techniques**: In machine learning and statistics, classification is the problem of identifying to which of a set of categories (sub-populations) a new observation belongs, on the basis of a training set of data containing observations (or instances) whose category membership is known. Eg. Naive Bayes classifier, Logistic regression etc.

* (ii4) **Parameter Optimization**: In the context of machine learning, parameter optimization or model selection is the problem of choosing a set of parameters for a learning algorithm, usually with the goal of optimizing a measure of the algorithm's performance on an independent data set. Often cross-validation is used to estimate this generalization performance.
