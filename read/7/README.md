## (i) Reference : Ghotra, Baljinder, Shane McIntosh, and Ahmed E. Hassan. "Revisiting the impact of classification techniques on the performance of defect prediction models." In Proceedings of the 37th International Conference on Software Engineering-Volume 1, pp. 789-800. IEEE Press, 2015.


## (ii) Keywords:

* (ii1) **SNA**:

## (iii) Brief Notes:

* (iii1) **Motivation** : Their results suggest that some classification techniques tend to produce defect prediction models that outperform others on contrary to earlier research which stated the classification techniques didnt matter.

* (iii2) **Patterns** : logistic regression and linear regression, Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines, Personalized Change Classification, and Logistic Model Trees. Ensemble methods that combine different machine learning techniques have also been explored. Lessmann et al. [34] conducted a study comparing the performance of 22 different classification techniques on the NASA corpus. Their results show that the performance of 17 of the 22 classification techniques are statistically indistinguishable from each other.
